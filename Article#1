What are the best technologies in IT to learn to get placed in a good MNC with the best package?
================================================================================================

According to Forbes, these are the top skills that is in demand this 2018!

But before that let me give a brief introduction regarding the tech employment opportunities. It is expected to increase by 12% by 2024 leading to more and more jobs for IT professionals. The number of tech positions includes fields in web development, cybersecurity and the analysis is expected to grow exponentially within the next year, and the competition might be tougher in acquiring a skilled job is not updated with these new technologies.

Now let us look at the skills in demand this 2018:[1]

Data Science Talent
With the rise of big data and machine learning, data scientists are becoming a key component in many industries -- from finance and banking to health care and drug discovery. Companies will be investing on a big scale in talent acquisition in this field.

Coding And Engineering Experience
An engineering mind and coding skills are now essential for the high-tech industry. Everything is about new ways to build and use products and services that are more intuitive.

Programming Knowledge
Programming, especially with multi-faceted languages like JavaScript and Python, are the most in demand, whether you're an infrastructure engineer, software engineer or even a digital marketing professional. These languages are not only used to build scalable applications but also to automate, streamline processes or crawl data across disparate systems.

Any Skills Related To Analytics
Machine learning and data analytics are going to continue to grow and change the face of the IT industry as we know it today. I’ve even encouraged my daughter to take analytics as her major knowing that it’s going to be a game-changer in the near future.

Applied Machine Learning
Data science has been growing rapidly as a profession. But if data science applies in settings where we care about the interpretability and theoretic soundness of the methodology, like any science, applied machine learning is just about the results. Being able to experiment with common neural networks in Tensorflow will outstrip tinkering with R programming as demand increases.

Ability To Adapt To New Tech
One of the most important characteristics of a tech star is the ability to adapt to new technologies. It is almost impossible to predict what will be the norm six months from now. Someone who is constantly learning will be very successful in the future of this unpredictable field.

Talent For SaaS In The Cloud
IT professionals with skills in cloud computing and software as a service (SaaS) will be the hot ticket in 2018. Virtualization skills in Amazon AWS, Microsoft Hyper-V and VMware for private cloud hosting will, without a doubt, help you stand out from the crowd. Experience with DevOps, containers, the entire cloud stack and IPv6 will also benefit your chances for a top job tremendously.

Experience With AI
The field of artificial intelligence is seriously understaffed. Specifically, finding technology leaders (CIO/CTO, head of product, etc.) who know how to credibly manage teams made up of AI, data science and innovative product specialists will prove to be difficult going forward.

The in-demand job roles includes Data Scientists, Data Engineers, Machine Learning Experts, Front-end developers, Full Stack developers etc.

Now that the skills and job roles are mentioned, I hope you now have a clearer picture of what you’re supposed to learn this 2018.

You should also know that job seekers will offer an array of technical skills that the employers are looking for, this will totally depend on the kind of perks and compensation they will receive. But apart from the technical skills they should also possess soft skills which normally isn’t apparent in the portfolio. The ability to communicate to others and share one’s insight can go a long way for potential candidates looking to get into the tech domain.

Now what can one do?

One can simply look for the areas that he/she wishes to get into e.g. Data Science or Web Development.

You can simply follow three simple rules:

Acquire the skills that most companies are looking to hire for.
Work on projects so that one not only learn the skills but also have a technical expertise as well.
Build portfolio that is appealing and will make your skills stand out from others.
Look for companies hiring in this field, apply and get hired by them.
From where can one learn these skills if he’s a fresher?

Being a fresher can be tough if one is looking to get into the IT space, you will get a job but the job will not be as expected. This is one reason why developers and programmers are looking forward to learn newer technologies to make one competent enough with the trending advancements.

If you just browse through the internet, you will find many online portals offering these kind of learning skills in these new technologies. Such names are Udacity, Udemy edWisor and many others..

edWisor - this is one only platform where the candidates and students not only learn all the skills related to web development or data science but also get the opportunity to get placed in companies and startups. There are over 200+ companies hiring from edwisor. You can try here since you’re a fresher and they’re job oriented.
Udacity - this is one platform which has great courses and programs specially in data science. However, getting a nano degree program can cost you so much and yet you won’t be offered a job, at least in India I guess the nano degree does not work much here.
Udemy - this platform offers good learning skills in newer technologies but most of them are single technologies so you will have to buy the course separately. As in, if you’re looking to learn MEAN Stack development, you’ll have to purchase separate courses, this might be a little tough in managing and keeping up pace. Plus they only offer certificates and job assistance.
